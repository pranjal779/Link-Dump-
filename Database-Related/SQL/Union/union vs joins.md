the UNION and JOIN clauses in SQL combine data differently and produce different result formats. Both clauses can combine data from two or more tables, but JOINs combine data into new columns, while Unions combine data into new rows:
JOIN
Combines attributes from two relations to form tuples. For example, when two tables are joined, the data from the first table appears in one set of columns alongside the second table's columns in the same row. There are four main types of JOINs in SQL: INNER JOIN, OUTER JOIN, CROSS JOIN, and SELF JOIN.
UNION
Combines the results of two or more SELECT command queries into a single result set. For example, when two tables are "unioned" together, the data from the first table is in one set of rows, and the data from the second table is in another set of rows in the same result. Unions also eliminate duplicates from the combined results.

There is a major difference between JOIN and UNION in SQL. Using the JOIN clause, we combine the attributes of two given relations and, as a result, form tuples. Whereas we use the UNION clause when we want to combine the results obtained from two queries. They both combine data differently.
